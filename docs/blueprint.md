# **App Name**: Jal Seva Kendra

## Core Features:

- Dashboard Overview: Dashboard with key metrics (total supply hours, revenue) and recent activity.
- Customer Management: Customer management (CRUD operations, payment history, summaries).
- Automated Water Entry and Reporting: Water supply entry with automatic charge calculation and reporting.  The LLM acts as a tool to help determine anomalies in the data such as unusually long watering times that should be reviewed by the user for accuracy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3498db) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Secondary color: White for clean backgrounds and readability.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) for positive actions and success states (e.g., successful payment).
- Simple and clear sans-serif font (like Arial) for easy readability, especially on mobile devices.
- Use clear and intuitive icons for navigation and actions. Ensure icons are easily understandable by all users.
- Clean and organized layout with clear sections and spacing.  Prioritize important information and actions.

  - Home
  - Add Entry
  - Customers
  - Reports

### 2. New Water Supply Entry Screen

  - Date (with date picker)
  - Start time (with time picker)
  - End time (with time picker) 
  - Crop type (dropdown selection)
  - Save Entry button
- The app should automatically calculate the amount based on duration and crop type

### 3. Customer Details Screen
- Customer information:
  - Name
  - Mobile number
  - Village
